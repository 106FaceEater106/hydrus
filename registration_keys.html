			<h3>making new accounts</h3>
			<p>Although I hope you are now familiar with access keys, I have recently added <i>registration keys</i>.</p>
			<p>These are generated as server admins create new accounts, and are sent to new users. They work only once: to retrieve a new account's access key. After this, they become useless. As a result, they are safer to email and otherwise distribute than access keys.</p>
			<p>They look very similar to access keys; their only difference is they have an 'r' at the front, like so:</p>
			<p><i>r606927ce4a91114ee81d169ca57ef53fd07c12e3732b01ebcb59ea03d7d5b46e</i></p>
			<p>I am still developing how the gui handles these, but for now, the 'add' button on the <i>add, remove or edit services</i> dialog will now give you a simple new popup:</p>
			<p><img src="account_registration.png" /></p>
			<p>If you have a registration key, click above, and it'll give you a very simple form to fill in. If you have a normal access key, click below, and you'll be able to add the information manually as usual.</p>
			<p>For instance, if you want to connect to my public tag repository as per <a href="access_keys.html">here</a>, this is an existing, shared account that has already been initialised, so you would click below.</p>
