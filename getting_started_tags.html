			<h3>how do we find files?</h3>
			<p>So, we have stored our images and .swfs in a large database. Everything is hashed and cached. We can sort by inbox and resolution and size and a bunch of other quantitative metadata, but if we want to differentiate qualitatively, we shall have to use tags.</p>
			<p><a href="faq.html#tags">FAQ: hold up, what is a tag?</a></p>
			<p class="warning">The client starts with a 'local tags' service, which stores tags only on your client's database, where only you can see them. This is useful, and you should keep it in mind for specific jobs as you read the rest of this page, but please do not try to tag everything you own by yourself; unless you have a tiny collection, it will take you hundreds of hours, and your time is better spent helping build tag collections with other people.</p>
			<p>In order to share tags with others, you must connect to at least one tag repository. You can create your own, if you like, and share access with whoever you like. I run a public tag repository, which you are very welcome to access and contribute to:</p>
			<p><img src="edit_repos_public_tag_repo.png" /></p>
			<ul><li>4a285629721ca442541ef2c15ea17d1f7f7578b0c3f4f5f2a05f8f0ab297786f@hydrus.no-ip.org:45871</li></ul>
			<p>Tags are rich, cpu-intensive metadata, and it will take a few minutes for the repository to synchronise completely. The client will lag a little as it processes each update. You can watch its progress in the <i>services->review services</i> dialog as usual.</p>
			<h3>now let's find some files</h3>
			<p>Once you are all set up, you start to type in a tag, and the autocomplete dropdown will offer suggestions for you:</p>
			<p><a href="hidamari_ac.png"><img src="hidamari_ac.png" width="683" height="384" /></a></p>
			<p>Press up/down and enter to select, or double click with your mouse. Play with the buttons to see how they change your queries.</p>
			<p><a href="hidamari.png"><img src="hidamari.png" width="683" height="384" /></a></p>
			<p>More tags will narrow a search:</p>
			<p><a href="hidamari_miyako.png"><img src="hidamari_miyako.png" width="683" height="384" /></a></p>
			<p>Or, when prefixed with a hyphen, exclude:</p>
			<p><a href="hidamari_exclude.png"><img src="hidamari_exclude.png" width="683" height="384" /></a></p>
			<p>When you are more familiar with namespaces, sorting and collections, you can easily find and display whole books with just a few keystrokes:</p>
			<p><a href="gunnerkrigg_chapter.png"><img src="gunnerkrigg_chapter.png" width="683" height="384" /></a></p>
			<h3>creating tags</h3>
			<p>Hit F3 on a selection of files to open up the tagging dialog.</p>
			<p><a href="manage_tags.png"><img src="manage_tags.png" width="683" height="384" /></a></p>
			<p>The dialog shows the <b>intersection</b> of the current selection's tags, and will add tags to/remove tags from the entire selection. Type a new tag and press enter to add it, double click an existing tag to remove it. You may be prompted to give a reason for removing a tag, which an administrator will review. Hit <i>Apply</i> and the changes will be pended for upload, just like with files. Use the <i>pending</i> menu when you are ready.</p>
			<p>Please do not upload tags to my public tag repo until you get a rough feel for the <a href="tagging_schema.html">tag schema</a>, or just lurk until you get the idea. I am only interested in objective tags. If you don't like my guidelines, start your own tag repo!</p>
			<p>You can be connected to more than one tag repository. Press the up or down arrow keys on an empty input to quickly jump between your repositories. Each repo's beliefs about which tags go with which files will be applied according to a certain precedence that you can edit in <i>services->manage tag service precedence</i>.</p>

			<h3>typical usage</h3>
			<p>I find the following import-cycle works well for me:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>import anything in my downloaded images folder</li>
				<li>filter a few hundred from my inbox</li>
				<li>go system:archive, system:numtags<4 and tag some stuff</li>
				<li>upload pending tags</li>
				<li>feel good about myself</li>
			</ul>
