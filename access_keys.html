			<h3>first off</h3>
			<p>I have purposely not pre-baked this info into the client's install. You have to put it in yourself. It won't connect anywhere until you tell it to.</p>
			<h3>access keys</h3>
			<p><b><i>If this stuff be-fuzzles you, you can now go </i>help->i don't know what I am doing->just set up some repositories for me, please<i> and you _should_ be all set up automatically.</i></b></p>
			<p>I run a public, objective tag repository that <a href="tagging_schema.html">you are welcome to contribute</a> to. I also run a read-only file repository that you can search to get a feel for the interface. The files on my file repo are appropriately tagged in my tag repo.</p>
			<p><img src="edit_repos_public_tag_repo.png" /></p>
			<p><img src="edit_repos_file_repo.png" /></p>
			<p>Here's the info so you can copy it:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>public tag repository: 4a285629721ca442541ef2c15ea17d1f7f7578b0c3f4f5f2a05f8f0ab297786f@hydrus.no-ip.org:45871</li>
				<li>read-only file repository: 8f8a3685abc19e78a92ba61d84a0482b1cfac176fd853f46d93fe437a95e40a5@hydrus.no-ip.org:45872</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Tags are rich, cpu-intensive metadata, so it will take a few minutes for the repository to synchronise completely.</b> The client will lag a little as it processes each update. You can watch its progress in the services->review services dialog as usual.</p>
