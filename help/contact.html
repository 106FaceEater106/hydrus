			<h3>contact and links</h3>
			<p>Please send bug reports straight to my email or forum. Your other ideas and comments are always welcome.</p>
			<p>I don't really do chat, and I don't get caught up in the social stuff on twitter/tumblr. I like to spend a day or so to think before replying to non-urgent emails, but I do reply to everything.</p>
			<p>I delete all tweets and resolved email conversations after three months. So, if you think you are waiting for a reply, or I said I was going to work on something you care about and seem to have forgotten, please do nudge me.</p>
			<p>If you have a problem with something on someone else's server, please, <span class="warning">do not come to me</span>, as I cannot help. If your ex-gf's nudes have leaked onto the internet, or you find something terribly offensive, or you just plain hate the free flow of information, I cannot help you at all.</p>
			<p>Anyway:</p>
