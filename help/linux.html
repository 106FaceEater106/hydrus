			<h3>getting it to work on linux</h3>
			<p>I don't have a dev machine for linux (although this should soon change!), so your best bet is trying Wine. Here is a post from someone who has had success:</p>
			<i>
			<p>Ok, so I have got it working for some weeks now, I am not certain if it is because I got new computer, or if it was because of one of the new versions, or something totally other.</p>
			<p>Anyways, the way I got it to work in ubuntu was:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>0. Get a standard Wine installation</li>
				<li>1. Download the latest hydrus .exe file</li>
				<li>2. Run it with Wine</li>
				<li>3. This will open the installation program, choose where to put it, and continue</li>
				<li>4. When you get to the page where you choose to either "install" or "extract only", choose extract only</li>
				<li>5. Let it finish</li>
				<li>6. Start the terminal and start it with Wine (I am not sure if you could just run it from within nautilous)</li>
				<li><ul>
					<li>With the default folder it would be:</li>
					<li>wine /home/[USERNAME]/.wine/drive_c/Hydrus\ Network/client.exe</li>
					<li>Just change USERNAME to your username</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li>7. It should run just as it would on a windows computer</li>
				<li>8. ???</li>
				<li>9. Profit</li>
			</ul>

			<p>If you try to get the client running in linux, please let me know how you get on!</p>
