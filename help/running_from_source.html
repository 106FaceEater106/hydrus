			<h3>running from source</h3>
			<p class="warning">I should be able to improve compatibility with linux and os x soon! I'll rewrite this page then!</p>
			<p>the hydrus network is written entirely in <a href="http://python.org">python</a>, which can run straight from source. This is not recommended for someone who just wants to get the program working, but more for those who have a general interest or wish to modify their programs.</p>
			<h3>what you will need</h3>
			<p>You will need to install python 2.x and a few modules:
			<p><ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.wxpython.org/">wxPython</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">PIL</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://pyyaml.org/">pyYAML</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/">OpenCV</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/">PyCrypto</a></li>
				<li>The latest version of <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> (you may need to swap out the latest sqlite3.dll into your python/dlls directory)</li>
			</ul></p>
			<p>Once you have everything set up, just run client.pyw or server.pyw from your install directory. They will look for and run off the exact same database files as the executables would, and they'll hopefully run exactly the same too.</p>
			<p>I develop all this on 64-bit Win 7. I don't know how it runs on osx or linux, and don't personally have the means to find out. If you are good with python and want to make it work on non-windows, even compiling a release, go ahead! I'd be interested in how you get along.</p>
			<h3>my coding</h3>
			<p>I seem to work very much on a conceptual, boxes-and-arrows level. Although I <i>can</i> code in any language if I have to, I find the pedantic intricacies of C and its low-level friends a pain. But Python works for me right out of the box and is far more semantically rich; one line of intelligent and word-heavy python can do the work of 20 robotic <i>t+=ord(j_temp)%2;</i>s in C, and with such less fear of memory leaks or injection attacks or buffer overflows. I like long variable names and copious whitespace. I don't do much commenting because I am working alone and it usually makes quick sense to me, even when I haven't seen something for ages. If my code looks kooky to you, I'm sorry; my nerdism is INFJ, not INTP/J.</p>
			<p>I honestly don't know enough about the open source community to release my code under a specific licence, so everything is just public domain. In our internet age, copyright and copyleft seem to me equally impotent.</p>
