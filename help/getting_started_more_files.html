			<h3>exporting and uploading</h3>
			<p>There are many ways to export files from the client:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><b>drag and drop</b></p>
					<p>Just dragging from the thumbnail view will export (copy) all the selected files to wherever you drop them.</p>
					<p>The files will be named by their ugly hexadecimal hash, which is how they are stored inside the database.</p>
					<p>If you use this to open a file inside an image editing program, remember to go 'save as' and give it a new filename! The client does not expect files inside its db directory to change.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><b>export dialog</b></p>
					<p>Right clicking some files and selecting 'export all' will open this dialog:</p>
					<p><img src="export.png" /></p>
					<p>Which lets you export the selected files with custom filenames. The default export location is your export folder, which is set in <i>file->options</i>.</p>
					<p>You can do a lot with this. It'll initialise trying to export the files named by their hashes, but once you are comfortable with tags, you'll be able to generate much cleverer and prettier filenames.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><b>copy->copy all</b></p>
					<p>Right clicking some files and selecting 'copy all' from the copy submenu will copy them to your clipboard. You can then paste them wherever you like, just as with normal files. They will have their hashes for filenames.</p>
					<p>This is a very quick operation. It can also be triggered by hitting Ctrl+C.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><b>copy->hash/hashes</b></p>
					<p>Right clicking some files and selecting 'copy hash/hashes' will copy the files' unique identifiers to your clipboard.</p>
					<p>You will not have to do this often. It is best when you want to tell someone else <i>about</i> a number of files without giving them the files.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><b>copy->copy path/local url</b></p>
					<p>Right clicking any file and selecting 'copy path' will copy the file's raw database path (install_path/db/client_files/[hash]) to your clipboard. 'copy local url' does the same, but with a localhost url in the form http://127.0.0.1:45865/file?hash=[hash].</p>
					<p>These are useful when you want to send a single file to another program that won't accept a drag and drop. You can copy either of these addresses into a file open dialog like so:</p>
					<p><a href="upload.png"><img src="upload.png" width="960" height="600" /></a></p>
					<p>You can also paste into your browser's address bar, to check they are working.</p>
					<p>The path method will always work, the url method will only work while the client is running.</p>
					<p>The path method will send the file's hash as the filename, the url method might send something odd like file[7].</p>
					<p>If you use the path method to open a file inside an image editing program, remember to go 'save as' and give it a new filename! The client does not expect files inside its db directory to change.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>sharing files</h3>
			<p>The hydrus network has a service that lets clients share files anonymously, called a <i>file repository</i>.</p>
			<p>It simply stores files in a big pool. Anyone who has an access key to the repository can see the pool's thumbnails and download anything they like. They may also have permission to upload. Admins can delete. I run a download-only file repository, which you are welcome to connect to to get a feel for the interface. To add its details, go <i>services->manage services</i>, select 'files' on the left, and hit the 'add' button. You'll be asked if you have a registration key or an access key; you have an access key.</p>

			<p>Here's the info so you can copy it:</p>
			<ul><li>8f8a3685abc19e78a92ba61d84a0482b1cfac176fd853f46d93fe437a95e40a5@hydrus.no-ip.org:45872</li></ul>
			<p>Then go <i>services->review services</i> to see your client synchronise with the repository's file list.</p>
			<p><img src="review_services.png" /></p>
			<p>Hit F9, and you'll see your new repository under "files". A repository search page works exactly like a local one, it just uses a different file list. Files you do not have will be drawn with a dark background, those you do will be drawn as normal.</p>
			<p>To download a file, double- or middle-click it, or select from the right click menu.</p>
			<p>If you have permission to upload files to a particular repository, that option will appear in the right-click menu for any local files. Selecting this will pend them for batch uploading; just select from the new <i>pending</i> menu to effect the upload when you are ready.</p>
