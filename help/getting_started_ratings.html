			<p class="warning">This is all prototype! I'm still working on this document! The network will soon support remote, collaborative ratings!</p>
			<h3>what is the difference between tags and ratings?</h3>
			<p>To rate a file qualitatively, to say that it is funny or sexy or a wallpaper, tags are the tool to use. To rate a file quantitatively, to say that it is 3/5 stars or critically excellent or terrible, we use ratings.</p>
			<p>The hydrus client supports two kinds of ratings: <i>like/dislike</i> and a <i>&#x2124; out of &#x2124; + n</i> numerical rating. Let's start with the simpler one:</p>
			<h3>like/dislike</h3>
			<p>For now, since the client only supports local ratings, this is not terribly useful! You can define it in the <i>services->add, remove or edit services</i> dialog like so:</p>
			<p><img src="ratings_like.png" /></p>
			<p>You can set the words for like or dislike as you like!</p>
			<h3>&#x2124; out of &#x2124; + n</h3>
			<p>This is just a clever way of saying something like 3 out of 5 stars or 8/10. This other rating system is a numerical, integer-only input (whole numbers only, no 3.5/5) based system. You can set the range however you like:</p>
			<p><img src="ratings_numerical.png" /></p>
			<p>You can change these limits at a later date, and the database will adjust existing ratings appropriately (3/5 will go to 6/10, 9/10 will go to 4.5/5).
			<h3>now what?</h3>
			<p>Once you are sorted with your services, you can edit ratings for one or more files with F4:</p>
			<p><img src="ratings_dialog.png" /></p>
			<p>If you hit F4 on one file, the dialog will show that file's ratings. If you hit F4 on several files, it'll try its best to show you a summary of all the files' ratings. When you set new ratings with this dialog, the ratings will be applied to all files.</p>
			<h3>ratings filter</h3>
			<p>If you would like to rate many files quickly, the client now lets you 'filter' them, like with the inbox/archive filter. You select it from some thumbnails' right-click menu as usual.</p>
			<p><img src="ratings_menu.png" /></p>
			<p>This will launch a new fullscreen window that will show already rated files beside the images you wish to rate:</p>
			<p><img src="ratings_filter.png" /></p>
			<p>Once it has exhausted currently rated files, it will try to compare the unrated files with each other. The current controls are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Arrow key left or left mouse button: <b>the left image is better</b></li>
				<li>Arrow key right or right mouse button: <b>the right image is better</b></li>
				<li>Arrow key down or middle mouse button: <b>the files are about equal</b></li>
				<li>Arrow key up or space: <b>skip decision, and show another random comparison</b></li>
				<li>Backspace: <b>I didn't mean that, go back one</b></li>
				<li>Escape or return: <b>stop filtering now</b></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Every small decision you make will give the client another clue about how good a file is; e.g. if you say a file is better than a 7/10 file, it must be either 8/10, 9/10 or 10/10. The client will later show you a file in this range to narrow it down further.</p>
			<h3>so, what now?</h3>
			<p>Ratings will show in the preview screen and fullscreen views, like so:</p>
			<p><img src="ratings_preview.png" /></p>
			<p>You can search with system:rating, and sort in the normal manner:</p>
			<p><img src="ratings_sort.png" /></p>
			<p>And that's it! Remote ratings will make this a _little_ more complicated, but not much.</p>
