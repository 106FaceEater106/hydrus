			<h3>quick version</h3>
			<p>Tag parents let you automatically add a particular tag every time another tag is added. The relationship will also apply retroactively.</p>
			<h3>what's the problem?</h3>
			<p>Tags often fall into certain heirarchies. Files with certain tags <i>always</i> have certain other tags, and it is annoying and time-consuming to add them all individually every time.</p>
			<p>For example, whenever you tag a file with <i>ak-47</i>, you probably also want to tag it <i>assault rifle</i>, and maybe even <i>firearm</i> as well.</p>
			<p><img src="tag_parents_venn.png" /></p>
			<p>Another time, you might tag a file <i>character:eddard stark</i>, and then also have to type in <i>house stark</i> and then <i>series:game of thrones</i>. (you might also think <i>series:game of thrones</i> should actually be <i>series:a song of ice and fire</i>, but that is an issue for <a href="advanced_siblings.html">siblings</a>)</p>
			<p>Drawing more relationships would make a significantly more complicated venn diagram, so let's draw a family tree instead:</p>
			<p><img src="tag_parents_got.png" /></p>
			<p>If we were to search for the tag <i>house stark</i>, we would expect our results to include all the images of any of the Starks. Even so, it is tedious to have to remember to tag every image of a character with their house affiliation or other parent tags. You may not even remember.</p>
			<p>Wouldn't it be great if we could add these 'parent' tags at the same time?</p>
			<h3>tag parents</h3>
			<p>Let's define the relationship 'tag P is tag C's parent' as saying that tag P is the semantic superset/superclass of tag C. <b>All files that have C should have P, without exception.</b> Let's say that when the user tries to add tag C to a file, tag P is added automatically.</p>
			<p>Let's expand our weapon example:</p>
			<p><img src="tag_parents_firearms.png" /></p>
			<p>In that graph, adding <i>ar-15</i> to a file would also add <i>semi-automatic rifle</i>, <i>rifle</i>, and <i>firearm</i>. Searching for <i>handgun</i> would return everything with <i>m1911</i> and <i>smith and wesson model 10</i>.</p>
			<p>Although characters are an obvious and convenient step, we need to be careful to make sure we only link characters to series if they have unique names, and only if they are <i>inextricably</i> linked with their series. Series with crossovers and spinoffs (like CSI) make this difficult, so measure twice before you cut.</p>
			<h3>how you do it</h3>
			<p>Go to <i>services->manage tag parents</i>:</p>
			<p><img src="tag_parents_dialog.png" /></p>
			<p>Which looks and works just like the manage tag siblings dialog.</p>
			<p>Note that when you hit ok, the client will look up all the files with all your added tag Cs and retroactively apply/pend the respective tag Ps if needed. This could mean thousands of tags!</p>
			<p>Once you have some relationships added, the parents and grandparents will show indented anywhere you 'write' tags, such as the manage tags dialog:</p>
			<p><img src="tag_parents_ac_1.png" /></p>
			<p>Hitting enter on cersei will try to add <i>house lannister</i> and <i>series:game of thrones</i> as well.</p>
			<p><img src="tag_parents_ac_2.png" /></p>
			<h3>remote parents</h3>
			<p>Whenever you add or remove a tag parent pair to a tag repository, you will have to supply a reason (like when you petition a tag). A janitor will review this petition, and will approve or deny it. If it is approved, all users who synchronise with that tag repository will gain that parent pair. If it is denied, only you will see it.</p>
			<h3>strictness of tag parents</h3>
			<p><b>Tag parents are not strict!</b> If a parent relationship breaks down for whatever reason (e.g. Rule 63 screwing up character->gender), you can de-pend or petition any parent tag, and the client will not try to remove the children. Tag parents are only ever suggestions in write tag autocomplete dropdowns.</p>
