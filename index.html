		<h3>hydrus network - client and server</h3>
		<p>The hydrus network client is an application written for anon and other internet-fluent media nerds who have large image/swf collections. It browses with tags instead of folders, a little like a *booru on your desktop. Tags and files can be anonymously shared through custom servers that any user may run. Everything is free, and the source code is included with the release. It is developed for Windows, but fairly functional builds for Linux and OS X are released at the same time.</p>
		<p>The software is constantly being improved. I put out a new release every Wednesday at 8pm Eastern with an accompanying tumblr post to describe the week's changes.</p>
		<p>Currently supported filetypes are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>images - bmp, gif, png and jpg</li>
			<li>audio - mp3, ogg and flac</li>
			<li>video - webm, flv, mp4 and wmv</li>
			<li>misc - swf, pdf and zip</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The client can download and parse tags from a number of websites, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>4chan, with a thread watcher</li>
			<li>giphy</li>
			<li>a number of boorus</li>
			<li>tumblr</li>
			<li>deviant art</li>
			<li>newgrounds</li>
			<li>pixiv</li>
			<li>hentai foundry</li>
			<li>generic direct-image-linked gallery pages</li>
		</ul>
		<p>It can also dump images to existing 4chan threads.</p>
		<p>The program's emphasis is on your freedom. There is no DRM, no phoning home, no censorship.</p>
		<p>If you would like to try the program, I <i><b>highly</b></i> recommend you check out the <a href="help/index.html">help</a>. A copy is included with the release as well. It explains the basics of the network, and how to get connected.</p>
