		<h3>hydrus network - client and server</h3>
		<p>The hydrus network client is a desktop application written for Anonymous and other internet-fluent media nerds who have large image/swf collections. It organises your files into an internal database and browses them with tags instead of folders, a little like a *booru on your desktop. Tags and files can be anonymously shared through custom servers that any user may run. Everything is free, and the source code is included with the release. It is developed mostly for Windows, but fairly functional builds for Linux and OS X are available.</p>
		<p>The software is constantly being improved. I try to put out a new release every Wednesday by 8pm Eastern.</p>
		<p>Currently importable filetypes are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>images - bmp, gif, png and jpg</li>
			<li>audio - mp3, ogg and flac</li>
			<li>video - webm, flv, mp4 and wmv</li>
			<li>misc - swf and pdf</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Audio is not well supported yet, but for anything that doesn't work, you can easily launch any file in your default program from inside the client.</p>
		<p>The client can download and parse tags from a number of websites, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>4chan and 8chan, with a thread watcher</li>
			<li>any regular booru</li>
			<li>hentai foundry</li>
			<li>pixiv</li>
			<li>tumblr</li>
			<li>giphy</li>
			<li>deviant art</li>
			<li>newgrounds</li>
			<li>generic direct-image-linked gallery pages</li>
		</ul>
		<p>And it can be set to 'subscribe' to gallery searches, repeating them every few days to keep up with any new results.</p>
		<p>The program's emphasis is on your freedom. There is no DRM, no phoning home, no censorship.</p>
		<p>If you would like to try the program, I <i><b>highly</b></i> recommend you check out the <a href="help/index.html">help</a>. A copy is included with the release as well.</p>
