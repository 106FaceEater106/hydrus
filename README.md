## Hydrus Image Tagging Network (Client and Server)

An application designed to create a personal *booru-style image tagger, that can be viewed locally or shared anonymously using a custom server. 

This is the source-only release, meant for people who want to experiment with the code on non-windows systems; if you want a .exe, please check out the [compiled releases](http://www.mediafire.com/hydrus). All releases include original source code.

The program can do quite a lot! Please check out the help inside the release or [here](https://github.com/treeofsephiroth/hydrus/wiki).

## Changed files

The original program is not tracked in a Git repository, so we've done it ourselves. These are the only files that differ from the original.

## Original Text

If you are reading this, you probably extracted rather than installed, so you were not prompted to read the help.

The hydrus client can do a lot, so do please go into the help folder and open up index.html so you don't get lost. Thanks!
